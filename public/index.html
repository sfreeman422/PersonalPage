			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Steve Freeman is Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for creating useful, unique and efficient web applications designed to help others. Steve is passionate about backend technologies and enjoys exploring the latest and greatest libraries and frameworks in his everyday coding. Steve's skills primarily focus on JavaScript related libraries such as Node.js and Passport.js however, he also has an interest in Java, as this was the first programming language he tried to teach himself. He is passionate about all technology but takes a liking to Android, Linux and Mac. Outside of being a developer, Steve works full-time as a Systems Administrator. </p>

			<p>Steve's career started off as an all around IT Guy. When he was 16 years old, he began providing freelance IT support to a number of small businesses throughout Central NJ. Steve was always "good with computers" and was the go-to IT guy for his friends and family. He knew that technology had an important place in the world and looked to IT as a means of spreading the joy and helping people out. Throughout high school and college, Steve maintained his freelance endeavour and kept himself busy gaining the knowledge needed to help his customers out. After college, Steve briefly pursued an accounting career, as this was his major in college, before finally deciding to move towards IT. He began working as a Helpdesk Analyst at SHI International Corp, where he provided IT services for 2,500 users worldwide. After 2 years at SHI, he moved on to mindSHIFT where he is currently employed as a Customer Engineer I, which is essentially an on-site Systems Administrator for one of mindSHIFT's largest customers, CHDI Foundation. In this position, Steve is responsible for managing a whole slew of servers and systems running both Windows and Linux. It was during his time at this job, that Steve truly realized that his passion was in development. </p>

			<p>Steve finally found his place at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, a six month program designed to allow a full-time worker like himself to reap the benefits of bootcamp without having to drop everything. The course proved to change Steve's life as he now spends as much time as he can coding and learning about JavaScript and its many frameworks and libraries. Outside of coding, Steve tinkers with his ESXi server, which is hosting the site you are viewing right now, as well as commits his time to hackathons and other nerdy, coding adventures.</p>
